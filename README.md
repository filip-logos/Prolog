# Problem Description
Robert Bosch introduced the “Peaceably Coexisting Armies of Queens” problem
in his column in Optima in 1999. It is a variant of a class of problems requiring
pieces to be placed on a chessboard, with requirements on the number of squares
that they attack: Martin Gardner discusses more examples of this class In the
“Armies of Queens” problem, we are required to place two equal sized armies of
black and white queens on a chessboard so that the white queens do not attack
the black queens and necessarily vice versa and to find the maximum size of two such
armies. In other words, It consists of setting up opposing armies of queens of the same size on a n × n chessboard so that no queen attacks a queen of the opposing color.
The goal is to maximize the number N of queens (N black queens, N white queens) for a given size of chessboard.
